## 🔧 1. Hardware Components

| Component        | Purpose                  | Suggested Part                      |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Microcontroller | Brain of the device       | ESP32 (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth)           |
| 📍 GPS Module     | Location tracking        | u-blox NEO-6M / Quectel L86         |
| 📶 GSM Module     | Send location via SIM    | SIM800L / SIM7600 (4G)              |
| 🔋 Battery        | Rechargeable             | 3.7V Li-ion battery (1000–2000mAh)  |
| ⚡ Charging       | Power management         | TP4056 charging module              |
| 📦 Enclosure      | Waterproof & rugged      | Custom 3D printed or IP67 case      |
| 🐾 Collar/Strap   | Mountable                | Adjustable pet collar strap         |

**Optional Add-ons:**
- 📢 Buzzer (for alert sound)
- 🧠 Accelerometer (for activity tracking)
- 🔦 LED (for night visibility)

---

## 💻 2. Firmware / Device Logic (ESP32)

Use **Arduino IDE** or **ESP-IDF** to program the device.

### Core Features:
- Connect to GPS → Get latitude, longitude
- Send GPS data via GSM (HTTP POST or MQTT)
- Wake/sleep cycle to save battery
- Trigger alert if battery is low or pet leaves geofenced area

### Libraries to Use:
- `TinyGPS++`
- `HTTPClient`
- Low power libraries (`esp_sleep`, etc.)

---

## 🗺️ 3. Backend & APIs

A backend server is required to handle data from the GPS device and serve it to the mobile app.

### Suggested Stack:
- **Backend**: Node.js / Flask / PHP
- **Database**: Firebase / MongoDB / MySQL
- **Hosting**: Firebase, Heroku, Render, or VPS

### API Endpoints:
| Method | Endpoint                 | Description                        |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/location`              | Device sends location data         |
| GET    | `/pet/:id/location`      | Fetch pet's current location       |
| POST   | `/geofence`              | Define safe zones                  |
| GET    | `/alerts`                | Get alerts (low battery, out of zone) |

---

## 📱 4. Mobile App (React Native / Android Java)

### Key Screens:
- **Live Map View** – Show real-time location
- **Pet Profile** – Name, photo, age, ID
- **History** – Track movement over past 24 hours
- **Safe Zone Setup** – Set geofence on map
- **Notifications** – Receive alerts & updates

### Recommended Libraries:
- React Native Maps / Google Maps SDK
- Firebase Auth + Notifications
- Axios (for API integration)

---

## 💡 5. Power Optimization Tips

- Use **ESP32 deep sleep** when idle
- Upload location every X minutes (configurable)
- Add **magnetic switch** to detect when worn
- LED/Buzzer off by default, triggered only when needed

---

## 🛠️ 6. Manufacturing Tips

- Convert breadboard prototype to PCB (EasyEDA / KiCad)
- Order small batches from **JLCPCB**, **SeeedStudio**
- Use **TPU 3D printing** or mold waterproof casing
- Perform waterproof testing before full production

---

## 🛒 7. Selling & Branding

- Register as a seller on **Amazon / Flipkart**
- Create brand name, custom packaging, QR-activated setup guide
- Optional **monthly subscription** plans OR market as **lifetime no-subscription**
- Partner with pet stores/shelters for local pilot programs

---

## 🎁 BONUS: Unique Features to Stand Out

- 📱 **NFC Pet Tag** – Tap to view pet details/contact
- 🔊 **Voice Recall** – Play owner's voice remotely
- ✉️ **Offline Mode** – SMS location if no internet
- 📡 **Dual Tracking** – Use Wi-Fi indoors for fallback
